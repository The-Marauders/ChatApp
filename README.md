Problem Name:- Intra Deparment Messaging App
Problem Statement:- The app should enable officers and designated staff from the department to message each other as well as broadcast messages to everyone if necessary. All officers and designated staff should install the app from their preferred app store and register themselves by providing their name and section (a dropdown listing all available sections within the department). The concerned department should make the installation of this app a part of an employeeâ€™s joining process. App users should also be able to attach documents to individual or group messages. They can also select one/several sections to which they can broadcast messages. The status of their availability may also be shown like Whatsapp so that it is convenient to contact them. This system would be useful particularly in a large department where contacting large groups of people and sharing info/documents is inconvenient and time consuming.
